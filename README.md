# mkanren

Implementation of the microkanren relational programming language in scheme.  
For information on how to write microkanren programs, visit the [minikanren website](minikanren.org).  
Microkanren is a subset of minikanren which does not support logical constraints (=/=,absento,numbero, etc.)

Additionally, a microkanren port of [my turing machine library](github.com/zotlann/turing-machine) is included.
